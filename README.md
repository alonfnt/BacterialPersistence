# BacterialPersistence

**Model 1:** only triggered persistence

**Model 2:** triggered and spontaneous persistence with same wake up rate, lambda.

**Model 3:** triggered and spontaneous persistence with different wake up rates, lambda and omega.

### In *scripts*
**Part 1:** computing optimal persistence parameters with one or no competitors. Either as long term average or ensemble average.

**Part 2:** computing average persistence parameters when allowing mutation, or competition between all species.
